### Diachronic Structure (6 Phases)
- **Initiation** (0-30s): Lucas begins to settle into the meditative practice with a sense of stable centrality and focus around the spine, pelvis, and nostrils.
- **Becoming Porous** (30-60s): Lucas experiences a sensation of his head feeling untethered and the boundaries becoming porous, with a coolness as if the room's air is inside his head.
- **Tingling and Fizzing** (60-90s): A tingling sensation spreads from the fingertips, likened to bubbles popping and moving quickly through the arms, leading to a feeling of the body losing its defined structure.
- **Dissolution of Self** (90-120s): The concept of 'self' begins to dissolve, with Lucas experiencing a loss of bodily identity, leading to a state of expansive awareness and a non-linear perception of time.
- **Golden Water State** (120-150s): Lucas settles into a stable state characterized by a sense of benevolent space, a feeling of being held by the environment, with his awareness expanding beyond his body.
- **Return to Self** (150-180s): A sudden intake of breath disrupts the state, leading to a shattering of the expansive awareness and a return to a confined sense of self, accompanied by feelings of loneliness and loss.

### Phenomenological Summary
# Results and Discussion

## Phenomenological Summary
The experience unfolded through a sequence of phases, each marked by distinct sensory and emotional dynamics. Initially, Lucas entered a state of 'Initiation,' marked by stable corporeal and affective centering around the spine and nostrils. As the practice deepened, he experienced 'Becoming Porous,' characterized by a sensation of the head becoming untethered and its boundaries blurring. This transited into a phase of 'Tingling and Fizzing,' where tingling sensations akin to bubbles moving rapidly spread through the body, leading to 'Dissolution of Self,' a profound phase where personal identity dissolved and an expansive awareness emerged. Eventually, Lucas reached the 'Golden Water State,' described as a stable and benevolent expansiveness. However, the 'Return to Self' phase abruptly shattered this expansive awareness, bringing forth feelings of loneliness and loss.

## Theoretical Implications
The findings highlight several dimensions of the Extended Phenomenological Map. Corporeality is prominently featured in the 'Initiation,' 'Becoming Porous,' and 'Tingling and Fizzing' phases, showcasing a transition from stable centrality to an expanded bodily awareness. The dissolution of self indicates an intense interaction with Ipseity, challenging the rigid boundaries of personal identity. Temporal experiences, particularly in 'Dissolution of Self,' suggest a non-linear perception of time, consistent with the theme of Temporal Alteration in the invariants. The experience of 'Golden Water State' points to an expansive intentional dimension, where attention projects beyond bodily confines.

## Clinical/Practical Relevance
This phenomenological analysis offers insights for therapeutic practices focused on mindfulness and meditative states. The described phases underscore potential therapeutic pathways for facilitating self-dissolution and overcoming rigid identity constructs, which may benefit individuals grappling with anxiety or depersonalization. The emotional landscape of benevolent space observed in 'Golden Water State' could also inform therapeutic environments aiming to foster feelings of kindness and security.

## Limitations & Future Directions
While the study provides a rich tapestry of phenomenological insights, the data is limited to a single participant, which may not capture diverse individual experiences. Future research might explore variations across different perceptual faculties or psychological backgrounds, thereby enhancing the generalizability of findings. Additionally, longitudinal studies could investigate how repeated exposure to such states impacts psychological and emotional well-being over time.

### Phenomenological Summary
# Results and Discussion

## Phenomenological Summary
The participant's experience unfolds through a complex interplay of emotional, cognitive, and physical dimensions over a brief temporal trajectory. Initially, the participant engages deeply with their environment, as indicated by heightened environmental perception and a consequential sense of immersion. Entering the 'Recalling the Setting' phase, they report feelings of heaviness and mild confusion, creating a corporeal and affective tension. This escalates during the 'Building Tension' phase, where the participant's introspection into their job situation heightens emotional confusion and a physical sensation of tightness.

At the 'Moment of Decision,' a pivotal cognitive shift occurs, described as a 'switch' in the participant's head, marking a transition from distress to empowerment. This decision leads to an immediate release of tension as the participant feels a lightness, indicative of a change in corporeal and affective states. In the final phases, 'Empowerment and Reflection' and 'Closure,' the participant experiences positive self-dialogue and pride, reinforcing their self-identity and highlighting the importance of listening to one's body.

## Theoretical Implications
The study's findings align closely with the Extended Phenomenological Map's dimensions, particularly illustrating the dynamics and transformations within corporeality, intentionality, temporal perception, and emotional affectivity. The participant's experience underscores corporeality, transitioning from heaviness to relaxation, while intentional dimensions register as attentiveness shifts from external to self-focused. Additionally, the pronounced cognitive shift aligns closely with elevated cognitive intensity, demonstrating the importance of embodied decision-making processes. Lastly, altered temporality, perceived as time slowing, emphasizes the subjective nature of time during critical decision-making events.

## Clinical/Practical Relevance
These insights are significant for therapeutic settings, where understanding the interplay between cognitive, affective, and corporeal dimensions can enhance strategies for dealing with emotional decision-making processes. Recognizing similar body sensations as indicators of pivotal cognitive shifts can aid individuals in therapy to identify and navigate crucial emotional decisions, potentially fostering empowerment and self-validation.

## Limitations & Future Directions
This research provides a single, detailed perspective of the decision-making experience, which may not universally apply across varying situations or cultural backgrounds. Additionally, the focus is on the individual experiential level, suggesting potential bias from personal interpretations. Future research should consider diverse populations and contexts to broaden understanding. Further exploration into other phenomenological dimensions and their interplay could enhance the application of findings within therapeutic or other practical settings.

### Phenomenological Summary
# Results and Discussion

## Phenomenological Summary
The lived experience of anxiety as reported by participants unfolds in a sequential manner categorized into five phases: Initiation, Escalation, Climax, Resolution, and Reflection. Initially, during the Initiation phase, individuals report a sensation of tightness and pressure in the chest, marking the initial onset of anxiety. This experience of corporeal discomfort is captured by codes such as "2.6.3 Pecho" and "2.4.1 Presión," emphasizing the thematic presence of bodily tension.

As the experience progresses to the Escalation phase, a heightened sense of anxiety is felt, characterized by struggles in breathing and fear of suffocation, with dominant expressions of "2.1.10 Ansiedad" and somatic symptoms like "2.4.12 Temblor." During this period, temporal perception begins to shift slightly, indicative of the intensifying emotional state.

The Climax of the experience reveals profound changes in temporal and self-perception, with sensations of trembling and cold physical manifestations contributing to feelings of altered reality and self-detachment. In this phase, participants experience what they describe as "Self-Despersonalización" and "6.4 Percepción de tiempo alterada."

In the Resolution phase, grounding strategies aid in regaining control over emotions and physical sensations, indicating a reduction in affective intensity and the emergence of cognitive strategies characterized by "3.3 Autodiálogo amable" and "2.4.6 Liviandad." 

Finally, in the Reflection phase, a deeper understanding between mind and body is acknowledged, leaving participants with a lasting sense of lightness after sharing their experiences.

## Theoretical Implications
The findings suggest strong interactions between the dimensions of corporeality and affective states, with initial high intensities of bodily tension in the chest correlating with the onset and escalation of anxiety. Temporal distortions during the Climax highlight significant cognitive-affective interactions, where intense emotional states warp time perception, aligning with the "Altered Time Perception" invariant.

Furthermore, the dynamics of self-detachment observed during peak anxiety experiences lend support to theories of depersonalization as a defense mechanism during overwhelming affective experiences. The narrative structure and dominant codes portray a phenomenon in harmony with established phenomenological frameworks, wherein corporal experiences fundamentally influence affective and temporal experiences.

## Clinical/Practical Relevance
Understanding the diachronic flow of anxiety experiences provides vital insights for clinicians. The early identification of bodily sensations as precursors to anxiety escalation presents opportunities for interventional grounding strategies to prevent the progression to Climax or depersonalization stages. By enhancing the client's bodily awareness and fostering reflective practices, as observed in the Reflection phase, therapists can aid in transforming anxiety experiences into positive somatic releases.

## Limitations & Future Directions
While the study offers valuable insights into the phenomenological structure of anxiety, it is limited by its reliance on subjective narratives, which might lack generalizability. Future research could explore longitudinal studies involving diverse populations to elucidate the nuances of anxiety experiences further. Additionally, integrating psychophysiological measures to correlate subjective reports with objective markers could enrich the understanding of phenomenological dynamics.
