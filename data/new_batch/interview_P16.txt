Participant P16:
"Panic. Pure panic. My vision blurred. I couldn't hear anything but a high-pitched ringing. My hands were sweating so much. I felt like I was going to throw up. The edge felt like a monster waiting to eat me. I don't remember jumping, I just remember the sensation of falling and the terror in my stomach."
