Participant P15:
"It was a test of will. I wanted to see if I could override my biology. I stood there for a long time, just breathing. Regulating my pulse. I felt a sense of control. The jump was a release of that control, but a planned one. I felt weightless, but not afraid. It was like floating in a void."
