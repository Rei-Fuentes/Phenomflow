Participant P12:
"Oh god, it was too much. As soon as I saw the edge, my heart started pounding in my throat. I couldn't breathe. I felt this heat rising up my neck. I wanted to run away but my legs were frozen. I was crying, I think. The fear was overwhelming, like a wave crashing over me. When I jumped, it wasn't a choice, my knees just gave out. I screamed the whole way down. It was pure chaos."
