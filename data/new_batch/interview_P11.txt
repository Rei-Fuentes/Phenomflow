Participant P11:
"I approached the edge very methodically. I wasn't feeling much emotion, just a calculation. I looked down and estimated the distance. It felt like a physics problem. My body was calm, maybe too calm. I felt a coldness in my hands, but my mind was clear. I decided to jump not out of despair, but as a logical conclusion to the scenario. The fall was silent. I didn't scream. I just observed the wind rushing past."
