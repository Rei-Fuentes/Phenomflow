Participant P14:
"I felt dizzy immediately. The world was spinning. I clutched my chest because it hurt, physically hurt. The anxiety was a sharp pain. I remember pleading with myself to stop. The jump felt like being ripped apart. I was terrified. My whole body was shaking uncontrollably even after I took the headset off."
