"I remember thinking about the texture of the building. It looked fake. That helped me detach. I didn't feel like I was there. I was a camera floating above. The decision to step off was mechanical. One foot, then the other. No fear, just execution. During the fall, I analyzed the graphics. It was a very cerebral experience, devoid of the usual survival instinct."
