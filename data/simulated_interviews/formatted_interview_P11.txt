Given the complexity and length of the request, I'll provide a detailed, but necessarily abbreviated, version of a micro-phenomenological interview transcript focusing on the taste of a specific food and the Proustian moment it evokes.

---

<I> Let's start by finding a comfortable position. Are you ready to begin our journey into your experience?
<L011> Yes, I'm ready.
<I> Good. I'd like you to recall a moment when tasting a specific food brought back a vivid memory. Can you think of such a moment?
<L011> (Nods) Yes, I can.
<I> Great. Let's go there together. Take your time to bring this moment back to life in your mind. What is the first thing that comes to your awareness?
<L011> (Closes eyes) The warmth of the kitchen.

**Evocation Phase**

<I> The warmth of the kitchen. Can you describe more about this warmth? How does it feel?
<L011> It's cozy, enveloping. Like a soft blanket around me.
<I> A soft blanket around you. And as you feel this warmth, what happens next?
<L011> I smell something... baking.
<I> You smell something baking. Can you describe this smell?
<L011> It's sweet, comforting. Like cinnamon and apples.

**Diachronic Exploration**

<I> Cinnamon and apples. Let's explore this moment step by step. As you're standing there, enveloped in warmth, smelling cinnamon and apples, what do you do next?
<L011> I walk towards the oven. I'm anticipating.
<I> Anticipating. What is this anticipation like?
<L011> It's a mix of excitement and a bit of hunger. My mouth waters.
<I> Your mouth waters. And then?
<L011> I see the pie. My grandmother is taking it out of the oven.
<I> You see the pie and your grandmother. How do you feel seeing her?
<L011> Happy. Safe. Loved.

**Synchronic Exploration**

<I> Happy, safe, loved. Let's zoom into the moment you see the pie. What do you see exactly?
<L011> The crust is golden brown, steam rising. There are bits of apple peeking out.
<I> Golden brown crust, steam rising. What happens inside you as you see this?
<L011> I feel a warmth in my chest, different from the room's warmth. More... intimate.
<I> More intimate. And then?
<L011> She cuts a piece and hands it to me. The texture is soft, flaky.
<I> Soft, flaky. As you take your first bite, what happens?
<L011> (Pauses) Time slows. The flavors explode—cinnamon, apple, butter. It's overwhelming but in a gentle way.

**Micro-returns and Exploration of Sensory Modalities**

<I> Time slows. Can you say more about how time slowing feels in your body?
<L011> It's like everything outside this moment fades. My senses sharpen. I'm here, fully.
<I> You're here, fully. And in this fullness, what do you taste exactly?
<L011> The sweetness of the apples, the richness of the butter, and a hint of cinnamon spice. It's complex.
<I> Complex. How does this complexity feel in your mouth?
<L011> It fills every part, like waves of flavor washing over me.
<I> Waves of flavor. And what do you hear in this moment?
<L011> The soft sound of the crust breaking, my grandmother's humming. It's peaceful.
<I> Peaceful. As you're experiencing this peace, what shifts in your sense of self?
<L011> I feel like a child again. Carefree. It's a part of me I thought I lost.
<I> A part of you thought lost. And in this rediscovery, how does your body feel?
<L011> Lighter. As if a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.
<I> Lighter. And as we sit here now, reflecting on this experience, what stays with you the most?
<L011> The connection. To my grandmother, to my past. It's like the pie bridged time and space.

**Closing**

<I> The pie bridged time and space. That's a beautiful way to put it. How do you feel now, having revisited this moment?
<L011> Grateful. And a bit emotional. It's more than just the taste; it's the love, the memories.
<I> Grateful, emotional. Thank you for sharing this deeply personal experience with me. How are you feeling about our conversation?
<L011> Thank you for guiding me through it. I feel... lighter, and it's comforting to reconnect with that moment.
<I> I'm glad to hear that. Remember, this experience, this connection, is always a part of you. Thank you for your trust and openness today.
