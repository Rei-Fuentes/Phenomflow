Interviewer (I): Claire
Participant (P): L012
Topic: Sensory overload
Method: Micro-phenomenological interview.

Interviewer (I): Let's begin by establishing a comfortable space for you to share your experience. Remember, there's no right or wrong here, just your experience. Are you okay with that?

Participant (L012): Yes, I'm okay with that.

Interviewer (I): Great. Today, we'll explore a moment of sensory overload you've experienced. I'll guide you through it, focusing on what you felt, saw, heard, and thought during that time. Let's start by finding a specific moment of sensory overload. Can you recall such a moment?

Participant (L012): (Pauses) Yes, I can. It was during a concert. The lights, the crowd, the noise—it was overwhelming.

Interviewer (I): You mentioned the lights, the crowd, and the noise. Let's go back to that moment. Try to relive it as vividly as possible. What's the first thing you become aware of?

Participant (L012): (Closes eyes) The first thing... it's the sound. The music is so loud, it's all I can focus on.

Interviewer (I): The music is loud, and it captures your focus. And as you're focusing on this loud music, what do you feel in your body?

Participant (L012): My heart is racing, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe.

Interviewer (I): Your heart is racing, there's tightness, and it's hard to breathe. Let's stay with this sensation of tightness. Can you describe it more? How does it feel?

Participant (L012): It's like... a band around my chest. It's squeezing me.

Interviewer (I): A band around your chest, squeezing you. And as you feel this squeezing, what happens next?

Participant (L012): I start to feel really hot, and my palms are sweaty. It's like I'm panicking.

Interviewer (I): You're feeling hot, your palms are sweaty, and there's a sense of panic. In this moment of panic, what do you notice about your surroundings?

Participant (L012): Everything seems to be moving too fast. The lights are flashing, people are moving around me, and the noise—it's just too much.

Interviewer (I): Everything is moving too fast. Let's explore this sense of speed. How does this perception of speed affect your sense of time?

Participant (L012): Time feels... distorted. Like everything is happening at once, but also dragging on forever.

Interviewer (I): Time is distorted, happening all at once but also dragging. As you're experiencing this, what shifts in your sense of self?

Participant (L012): I feel lost, like I'm not really there. I'm just... overwhelmed by everything around me.

Interviewer (I): You feel lost, not really there. Let's delve deeper into this feeling of being overwhelmed. What, in this moment, is the most overwhelming aspect for you?

Participant (L012): The noise. It's not just loud; it's consuming. I can't think or focus on anything else.

Interviewer (I): The noise is consuming. When you say "consuming," what do you experience in your mind?

Participant (L012): It's like my thoughts are being drowned out. I can't hold onto anything—it's just noise.

Interviewer (I): Your thoughts are being drowned out by the noise. And in this moment, how do you try to cope with what's happening?

Participant (L012): I... I try to close my eyes and block out the sound, but it's impossible. I feel trapped.

Interviewer (I): You try to close your eyes and block out the sound, feeling trapped. As you're feeling trapped, what do you wish for in that moment?

Participant (L012): I just want it to stop. I want silence, or at least a break from the intensity.

Interviewer (I): You want it to stop, to have silence. Let's move forward in time from this moment. What happens next?

Participant (L012): Eventually, I have to leave. I can't take it anymore. The moment I step outside, it's like I can breathe again.

Interviewer (I): You leave, and then you can breathe again. As you step outside and breathe, how does your body respond?

Participant (L012): My heart starts to slow down, and the tightness in my chest begins to loosen. It's a relief.

Interviewer (I): Your heart slows, and the tightness loosens. It's a relief. Reflecting on this experience, how has it impacted your approach to similar situations in the future?

Participant (L012): I'm more cautious now. I try to avoid places that might be too overwhelming or make sure I have a way to step back if I need to.

Interviewer (I): You're more cautious and make sure you have a way to step back. That's a significant adaptation. Thank you for sharing this deeply personal experience with me. How are you feeling now, having revisited this moment?

Participant (L012): It was intense to go back there, but I feel okay now. It's good to talk about it, to understand it better.

Interviewer (I): I'm glad to hear that talking about it has been helpful. Thank you again for your openness and trust in this process.
