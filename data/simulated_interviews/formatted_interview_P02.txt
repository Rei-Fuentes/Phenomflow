<I> So, let's begin by making sure you're comfortable and that you understand what we'll be doing today. We're going to revisit a specific moment of decision-making in your life. It's important that you try to relive this moment as vividly as possible, focusing on your sensory experiences, emotions, and thoughts as they unfolded. Are you okay with this?

<L002> Yes, I'm okay with it. I'm ready.

<I> Great. Let's start by finding a moment of decision-making that feels significant to you. Don't rush; take a moment to let one come to mind.

<L002> (Pauses) Okay, I have one.

<I> Good. Now, let's gently enter this moment together. Can you describe the setting to me? Where are you, and what's happening around you?

<L002> (Closes eyes) I'm standing in my kitchen, early morning, the light is soft. I can hear the faint sound of traffic outside.

<I> You're in your kitchen, it's early morning, and there's soft light. You hear faint traffic sounds. What are you doing in the kitchen?

<L002> I'm standing by the counter, holding a coffee mug, just staring out the window.

<I> Holding a coffee mug, staring out the window. As you stand there, what do you feel in your body?

<L002> There's this heaviness in my chest, and my hands are kind of tense around the mug.

<I> Heaviness in your chest, hands tense around the mug. Can you describe that heaviness a bit more? What's its texture?

<L002> It's like a weight, a pressing down sensation. It's not painful, but it's uncomfortable.

<I> A pressing down sensation, uncomfortable but not painful. And in this moment, what leads to the decision you're about to make?

<L002> (Pauses, takes a deep breath) I'm thinking about my job, the one I've been unhappy with. I realize I can't do it anymore.

<I> You're thinking about your job, realizing you can't do it anymore. What changes in your body as this thought comes?

<L002> The heaviness gets more intense, and my stomach starts to knot up.

<I> The heaviness intensifies, and your stomach knots up. What happens next?

<L002> I make the decision to quit. It's like a switch flips in my head.

<I> A switch flips in your head as you decide to quit. When that switch flips, what happens in your body?

<L002> (Pauses) Suddenly, the heaviness lifts a bit, and my grip on the mug loosens.

<I> The heaviness lifts, and your grip loosens. How does the room around you feel at this moment?

<L002> It feels brighter, almost like the light in the room changed.

<I> The light seems to change, feels brighter. And what about the sounds around you?

<L002> The traffic noise outside seems farther away, less intrusive.

<I> Traffic noise feels farther away. Now, let's zoom into the moment right before you made the decision. What's happening inside you?

<L002> There's a battle going on. Part of me is scared, but another part is hopeful.

<I> A battle between fear and hope. Can you describe how each of these feels in your body?

<L002> Fear feels cold, like ice in my veins. Hope is warmer, lighter, like a gentle pressure pushing me forward.

<I> Cold fear, warm hope. How do these sensations interact or change as you come to your decision?

<L002> They kind of swirl together, then the warmth overpowers the cold. That's when I decide.

<I> They swirl, then warmth overpowers the cold. In this moment of decision, how does your sense of time feel?

<L002> Time slows down. It feels like I'm in this bubble where everything outside is paused.

<I> Time slows, everything outside is paused. And your sense of self, how does it shift or change in this moment?

<L002> I feel more solid, like I'm finally listening to myself. It's empowering.

<I> More solid, listening to yourself, empowering. As you make the decision, what's the first thing you do?

<L002> I take a deep breath, put down my mug, and say out loud, "I'm going to do it."

<I> You take a deep breath, put down the mug, and speak your decision out loud. How does saying it out loud make you feel?

<L002> It makes it real. I feel a rush of relief and a bit of fear, but mostly I feel free.

<I> It becomes real, a mix of relief, fear, and freedom. Looking back at this moment, how do you perceive it now?

<L002> It was a turning point. Scary but necessary. I'm proud of myself for making that choice.

<I> A turning point, scary but necessary, and you're proud. Is there anything else about this moment that stands out to you now as we talk about it?

<L002> Just how important it is to listen to what my body and emotions are telling me. They knew before my mind made it official.

<I> The importance of listening to your body and emotions, as they knew before your mind did. Thank you for sharing this moment with me so openly. How do you feel now, having revisited it?

<L002> I feel a bit emotional but in a good way. It's like I've reconnected with a part of myself.

<I> Emotional, but positively, reconnecting with a part of yourself. That's a powerful reflection. Thank you for your trust and openness today. Is there anything else you'd like to add or explore about this experience?

<L002> No, I think we've covered it. This has been really enlightening. Thank you.

<I> You're welcome. Thank you for your courage and willingness to explore this moment with me. Take care of yourself as you transition out of this space.
