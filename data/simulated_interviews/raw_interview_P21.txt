Interviewer (I): Let's begin by making sure you're comfortable and that the purpose of our session today is clear to you. We'll be exploring a specific experience you've had, focusing on the feeling of being watched. Our goal is to revisit this moment as vividly as possible, to understand the sensations, emotions, and thoughts you experienced. Are you okay with this?

Participant (L021): Yes, I'm okay with it. I'm ready to start.

Interviewer (I): Great. I'd like you to close your eyes for a moment and take a few deep breaths. When you're ready, I want you to recall a specific instance when you felt like you were being watched. Can you describe the setting of this experience?

Participant (L021): (Closes eyes, takes a deep breath) It was late evening, and I was walking home from work. The streets were unusually empty, and there was this eerie silence.

Interviewer (I): You mentioned an eerie silence. As you're walking, what are the first signs you notice that make you feel like you're being watched?

Participant (L021): It's hard to pinpoint, but there was a sudden chill down my spine, and my steps became heavier. I felt a prickling sensation on the back of my neck, like eyes were on me.

Interviewer (I): A prickling sensation on the back of your neck. Can you describe that sensation a bit more? Was it like a physical touch, or more like a temperature change?

Participant (L021): It wasn't like a touch. More like when you feel a sudden drop in temperature, but just in that specific area on my neck.

Interviewer (I): Interesting. And as you felt this, what happened to your pace? You mentioned your steps became heavier.

Participant (L021): Yes, my pace... (pauses) I started walking faster, almost without realizing it. My breathing got shallow, and my heart was racing.

Interviewer (I): Your heart was racing. In that moment, as your pace quickened, how did your surroundings appear to you? Did anything change in how you perceived them?

Participant (L021): (Pauses, opens eyes briefly then closes them again) Everything seemed more... alert, I guess. The shadows from the streetlights looked longer, and every small sound made me jump. It was like my senses were heightened.

Interviewer (I): Senses heightened. Let's explore that a bit more. When you say your senses were heightened, what was the first sense that seemed to amplify?

Participant (L021): Definitely my hearing. I could hear everything, from the distant sound of traffic to my own heartbeat. It was overwhelming.

Interviewer (I): Overwhelming. And in this heightened state of awareness, did you try to identify the source of your feeling of being watched?

Participant (L021): I did. I kept looking over my shoulder, trying to see if someone was there. But every time I looked, there was no one.

Interviewer (I): No one there. How did that make you feel, looking back and not seeing anyone?

Participant (L021): More anxious, actually. It's like... the lack of finding anything made it worse. I started to question if I was imagining things.

Interviewer (I): Questioning your perception. As you continued to walk, how did this feeling evolve? Did it intensify, or did something change?

Participant (L021): It intensified for a while, but then, as I got closer to my house, it started to fade. Like I was moving out of an invisible field of watchfulness.

Interviewer (I): Moving out of an invisible field. That's a vivid description. When you felt this shift, how did your body respond? Did the sensations you described change?

Participant (L021): Yes, the chill and the prickling sensation on my neck subsided. My heartbeat slowed down, and my breathing became deeper, more regular.

Interviewer (I): And once you arrived home, how did you feel?

Participant (L021): Relieved, but still a bit shaken. It took me a while to shake off the feeling completely.

Interviewer (I): Looking back at this experience now, how do you perceive it? Has your understanding or feeling about it changed in any way?

Participant (L021): Reflecting on it now, it feels like a reminder of how our senses can amplify our emotions, how the mind can interpret signals in such a heightened way when we're vulnerable.

Interviewer (I): A reminder of the interplay between senses and emotions. Thank you for sharing this experience with such detail. How are you feeling now, after revisiting this moment?

Participant (L021): It was intense to relive it, but I feel okay. It's interesting to dissect these feelings and sensations with you.

Interviewer (I): I'm glad to hear you're feeling okay. It's important to process these experiences, and I appreciate your willingness to explore this moment so deeply with me. Is there anything else you'd like to add or any other sensations or thoughts that come to mind about this experience?

Participant (L021): No, I think we covered everything. It was a thorough exploration. Thank you for guiding me through it.

Interviewer (I): You're welcome, and thank you for your openness and participation. If you have any more thoughts or if there's anything else you'd like to explore in the future, please feel free to reach out.
