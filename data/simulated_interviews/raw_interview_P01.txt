Interviewer (I): Claire
Participant (P): Lucas
Topic: Experience of self-dissolution during mindfulness practice.
Method: Micro-phenomenological interview (Deep Iteration).

I: Lucas, thank you for agreeing to explore this experience. You mentioned a moment of "self-dissolution" during your practice yesterday evening. I would like us to return to that specific session. (...) Take all the time you need to let the context reappear. The room, the lighting, the sounds, your bodily posture... (...) Let me know when you are there.

P: (Closes eyes, adjusts position on the chair, takes a deep breath) (...) Yes. I am there. It is dim. The candle is flickering on the left. I can smell the incense... sandalwood.

I: Sandalwood. Stay with that smell for a moment. Does it have a specific location in your awareness at this moment, just before the experience?

P: It feels... distant. Like it's floating in the periphery. My focus is more central.

I: Your focus is central. Where exactly is "central"? How do you feel this centrality in your body?

P: It is a vertical line. I feel my spine. I feel the weight of the pelvis on the zafu. It is a sensation of... heavy stability. Like a pyramid.

I: A pyramid. And in this pyramid, where is your attention directed?

P: At the nostrils. I am following the air. Cool in, warm out.

I: Okay. Now, I want you to move forward very slowly... to the precise instant where this stability begins to shift. The very first micro-signal that something is different. (...) What happens?

P: (...) It is in the gap. Between the exhale and the inhale. Usually, it is just a turnaround point. But here... it hangs.

I: It hangs. Can you describe this "hanging"? Is it a temporal sensation? A spatial one?

P: Both. It feels like the air stops moving, but time also stops. It is a... hesitation.

I: A hesitation. And in that hesitation, what happens to the sensation of the "pyramid," the stability you mentioned?

P: It softens. Specifically in the neck.

I: Let's go to the neck. Right at that moment of hesitation. What do you feel in the neck?

P: A release. It feels like a tight wire inside the cervical spine suddenly goes slack.

I: A wire going slack. And when that wire goes slack, what is the immediate effect on your head?

P: My head feels... untethered. It feels like it floats up a millimeter.

I: It floats up. And as it floats up, does the sensation of "looking from behind the eyes" change?

P: Yes. That is the next thing. As the head floats, the pressure behind the eyes... evaporates.

I: Evaporates. When you say "evaporates," do you mean it disappears instantly? Or does it fade?

P: It dissolves. Like mist clearing. It starts at the center of the head and moves outwards.

I: It moves outwards. Follow that movement. Where does it go?

P: It moves out through the ears. It feels like... the boundaries of the skull become porous.

I: Porous. Stay with this sensation of porosity. How do you know your skull is porous? What is the tactile evidence?

P: It is a coolness. I feel the air of the room... *inside* my head.

I: You feel the air inside your head. Is there a difference in temperature between the "inner" air and the "outer" air?

P: No. That is the strange part. They become the same temperature. The barrier of the bone... I can't feel it anymore.

I: You can't feel the bone. So, at this moment, if I asked you "where is the limit of your head?", what would you say?

P: I couldn't say. It feels like a gradient. Dense in the center, and then... fading out into the room.

I: Fading out. Okay. Now, let's move to the rest of the body. You mentioned the hands before. As this porosity is happening in the head, what is happening in the hands?

P: (Pauses, brow furrows) (...) The hands are lagging a bit. They still feel solid for a moment. But then... the "fizzing" starts.

I: The fizzing. Let's zoom in on this. Where exactly does it start? In the fingers? The palms?

P: In the fingertips. Where they touch the jeans.

I: At the point of contact. Describe the texture of this fizzing. Is it rough? Smooth? Fast? Slow?

P: It is very fast. High frequency. Like... carbonated water. Bubbles popping.

I: Bubbles popping. And do these bubbles have a temperature?

P: Yes, they feel warm. A tingling warmth.

I: And as these bubbles pop, what happens to the sensation of "skin touching fabric"?

P: It gets confused. I can't tell which is the finger and which is the fabric. The bubbles are... shared.

I: The bubbles are shared. So the boundary is becoming a shared zone of vibration. Does this zone expand?

P: Yes. It shoots up the arms. Very quickly. Like a shiver, but continuous.

I: A continuous shiver. And when it reaches the shoulders... what happens to the sense of the "pyramid"?

P: The pyramid collapses. Not that I slump. But the *feeling* of structure... it melts. The spine is no longer a rod. It is a column of... flowing energy.

I: A column of flowing energy. Now, I want to ask about "Lucas." In this column of energy, where is the sense of "I"?

P: (...) It is slipping. It tries to hold on to the breath.

I: It tries to hold on. How does that "trying" manifest? Is it a tension? A thought?

P: It is a tension in the solar plexus. A tiny knot. A feeling of... "Wait, what is this?"

I: "Wait, what is this?" Is that a verbal thought? Or a feeling of alarm?

P: It is a pre-verbal alarm. A contraction.

I: A contraction in the solar plexus. Let's look at that contraction. Does it stop the expansion?

P: For a second, yes. It freezes the fizzing.

I: And then? What happens to resolve this freeze?

P: (...) I don't "do" anything. I just... notice the contraction. And because the attention is so wide... the contraction can't hold. It unravels.

I: It unravels. How does it unravel? Does it explode? Dissolve?

P: It melts. Like an ice cube in warm water. It just... spreads out into the rest of the heat.

I: It spreads out. And when that knot melts... what happens to the "I"?

P: It drops. The center of gravity... which was maybe hovering near the throat... drops right down into the pelvic bowl. And then... it expands out in all directions.

I: It expands out. Let's explore this expansion. Does it stop at the skin?

P: No. There is no skin. The skin is just... a denser area of the vibration. The expansion goes right through it.

I: It goes right through. How far does it go?

P: To the walls. I feel the walls of the room.

I: You feel the walls. How? Is it tactile?

P: It is... a sense of pressure. I can feel the solidity of the walls *against* my awareness. My awareness is filling the room like water fills a tank.

I: Like water filling a tank. So you are the water. And the walls are the container. In this state, where is the point of view? Are you looking from the center of the tank? Or are you everywhere in the water?

P: (Pauses) ... I am everywhere in the water. There is no center anymore.

I: No center. Let's test this. If a sound happens... you mentioned a car earlier. Let's go to that sound.

P: Yes. The car.

I: When the sound of the car enters this "water," where does it touch you?

P: It doesn't touch "me." It ripples *through* me.

I: It ripples through. Can you describe the trajectory of this ripple? Does it come from the left?

P: Geographically, I know the street is on the left. But phenomenologically... the sound arises *simultaneously* everywhere. It is a modulation of the whole space.

I: A modulation of the whole space. And does this modulation have an emotional tone?

P: It feels... intimate.

I: Intimate. Can you clarify "intimate" in this sensory context?

P: It feels like the sound is made of the same "stuff" as me. There is no separation. No "foreignness."

I: No foreignness. And time? In this intimate, centerless space... how is time behaving?

P: It is thick. It is not a line. It is a sphere.

I: A sphere. Explain that metaphor. How does a "sphere of time" feel?

P: It feels like everything is happening at once. The beginning of the car sound and the end of the car sound... are held in the same moment.

I: Held in the same moment. So there is a suspension of sequence. (...) Now, let's go deeper. Is there any sense of agency? If you wanted to scratch your nose... could you?

P: The concept of "nose" is gone. The concept of "scratching" is gone. There is just... being.

I: Just being. Is this state static? Or is there movement within it?

P: It is shimmering. It is very dynamic. It is like... silence that is alive.

I: Alive silence. (...) Now, I want to explore the emotional texture of this silence. You mentioned "benevolence" earlier. Let's look at that. Is it an emotion like "joy"?

P: No. Joy has a spike. This is flat. But it is a... warm flatness. It feels like... being held.

I: Being held. By what?

P: By the space itself. The space feels... kind.

I: The space feels kind. Does this kindness have a color? A texture?

P: It feels... golden. Not visually golden. But the *feeling* of gold. Heavy, warm, precious.

I: Heavy, warm, precious. (...) Now, we are deep in this state. What happens next? Does it stabilize? Or does it change?

P: It stabilizes for a while. Maybe a few minutes. I am just resting in this golden water.

I: Resting. And then? What disrupts this rest?

P: It is a thought. But a very strange thought.

I: Tell me about this thought. What is the content?

P: The content is... "I am disappearing."

I: "I am disappearing." And how does this thought appear? Is it a voice? An image?

P: It is a voice. But it sounds... distant. Like it is coming from a radio in another room.

I: A radio in another room. And how does the "water" react to this voice?

P: It ripples. There is a shudder.

I: A shudder. Where do you feel this shudder?

P: In the center. Where the solar plexus used to be. A sudden... gathering.

I: A gathering. Like a contraction?

P: Yes. The water tries to pull back into a drop.

I: It tries to pull back. And does it succeed?

P: For a moment, yes. I feel a sudden density in the chest. A fear. "I need to breathe."

I: "I need to breathe." So the breath had stopped?

P: I think so. Or it was so shallow I lost it. The body suddenly gasped.

I: The body gasped. Let's look at that gasp. What is the sensation?

P: A sharp intake of air. Cold. It hits the back of the throat.

I: Cold air hitting the throat. And what does that coldness do to the golden space?

P: It shatters it. Like glass.

I: It shatters. Is it instant?

P: Yes. The moment the cold air hits... the boundaries snap back.

I: Snap back. Describe that "snap." Is it painful?

P: It is... jarring. It feels like falling from a height and hitting the ground.

I: Hitting the ground. And where is the ground?

P: The body. I land back in the body.

I: You land back. What is the first thing you feel when you land?

P: Weight. Heaviness. And the pain in the leg.

I: The pain in the leg. Let's explore the return of the pain. How does it manifest?

P: It is a throbbing. Hot. Red.

I: Hot and red. And does it feel like "my" pain immediately?

P: Yes. Immediately. "My leg hurts." The "I" is back instantly to claim the pain.

I: The "I" claims the pain. And the rest of the room? The walls?

P: They recede. They become "objects" again. Over there. Separate from me.

I: Separate. And how do you feel about this separation?

P: A sense of loss. A constriction. I feel... small again. Lonely.

I: Lonely. (...) Take a moment to feel that loneliness. Where is it located?

P: In the chest. A dull ache.

I: A dull ache. (...) And as you sit there, back in the smallness... is there any residue of the golden water?

P: Yes. A memory in the cells. My skin still feels a bit... tingling. Like it remembers being a cloud.

I: It remembers being a cloud. (...) Thank you, Lucas. We have journeyed from the pyramid, through the fizzing, into the golden water, and back to the smallness. Is there anything else about that transition, the "shattering," that you want to clarify?

P: Just that... it wasn't violent. It was jarring, but... inevitable. The body needed to breathe.

I: Inevitable. Thank you.
