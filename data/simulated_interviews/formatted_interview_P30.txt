<I> Let's start by establishing what we're here to do today. We'll be exploring a specific experience you've had with anxiety or a panic attack. Remember, there's no right or wrong answers, just your experience. Are you comfortable with that?

<L030> Yes, I'm okay with that.

<I> Great. I want you to take a moment to recall a specific incident where you felt a strong sense of anxiety or had a panic attack. Don't tell me about it yet, just get a sense of that moment in your mind. Let me know when you have it.

<L030> (Closes eyes, takes a deep breath) Okay, I have it.

<I> Now, I'd like you to go back to that moment as if it's happening right now. Where are you?

<L030> I'm in my car, parked outside a grocery store.

<I> In your car. And as you're there, what's the first thing you notice as the experience begins?

<L030> My hands... they start to sweat, and there's this tightness in my chest.

<I> Your hands start to sweat, and there's a tightness in your chest. Can you describe that tightness a bit more? How does it feel?

<L030> It's like a band around my chest, squeezing.

<I> A band squeezing. And as you feel this band squeezing, what happens next?

<L030> I start to breathe faster, shallow breaths.

<I> You breathe faster, shallow breaths. And how do you feel about this change in your breathing?

<L030> It scares me. I feel like I can't get enough air.

<I> It scares you. You can't get enough air. What do you do in response to that feeling?

<L030> I try to take deeper breaths, but it doesn't really help. It feels like I'm fighting to breathe.

<I> You're fighting to breathe. And as this is happening, what do you notice about your surroundings?

<L030> Everything starts to feel distant, like I'm there but not fully. Sounds seem muffled.

<I> Sounds seem muffled, and everything feels distant. What's happening in your body at this point?

<L030> My heart is racing, and there's this dizziness, like I might faint.

<I> Your heart is racing, and there's dizziness. And in this moment, what are you thinking?

<L030> That I'm going to die, that I can't control it.

<I> You think you're going to die. And as you think that, how does your body respond?

<L030> It just ramps up, more intense. The fear is overwhelming.

<I> The fear is overwhelming. Can you tell me more about that fear? What does it feel like in your body?

<L030> It's all-consuming. My stomach knots up, and there's this cold rush that goes through me.

<I> A cold rush. And during this experience, how do you perceive time?

<L030> Time... it's like it slows down. Every second feels longer.

<I> Time slows down. And in this slowed-down time, what do you do next?

<L030> I remember trying to focus on something, anything. I looked at the clock in my car.

<I> You looked at the clock. And as you focus on the clock, what do you notice in your body?

<L030> My breathing starts to slow a bit, the tightness in my chest loosens slightly.

<I> The tightness loosens slightly. And how does that change make you feel?

<L030> A little hopeful, like maybe I can get through this.

<I> Hopeful. And then what happens?

<L030> I keep focusing on my breathing, on the clock, and gradually, the panic starts to fade.

<I> The panic starts to fade. And as it fades, what changes in your sensations?

<L030> My heart rate slows, the dizziness subsides, and I start to feel more present, less detached.

<I> More present. And how does your sense of self change as you become more present?

<L030> I start to feel more in control, like I'm not just my fear. I'm me, and I'm okay.

<I> You're you, and you're okay. And looking back at this experience now, how do you feel about it?

<L030> It's still scary to think about, but I also feel a bit stronger knowing I got through it.

<I> Feeling a bit stronger. Thank you for sharing this with me. How are you feeling right now, talking about this?

<L030> It's been intense reliving it, but I'm okay. It feels good to talk about it, actually.

<I> I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything else you'd like to add or explore about this experience?

<L030> No, I think we covered it. Thank you for helping me go through it like this.

<I> Of course. Thank you for your openness and courage in sharing this experience. Remember, this conversation is a step towards understanding and healing. Take care.
