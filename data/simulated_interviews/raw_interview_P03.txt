Interviewer (I): Claire
Participant (P): L003
Topic: Anxiety or panic attack
Method: Micro-phenomenological interview.

Interviewer (I): Let's start by creating a comfortable space for you to share your experience. Remember, there's no right or wrong here, just your experience. Are you okay with proceeding under these conditions?

Participant (L003): Yes, I'm okay with that.

Interviewer (I): Great. I'd like you to recall a specific moment when you experienced an anxiety or panic attack. Take your time to remember a particular instance.

Participant (L003): (Closes eyes) Okay, I've got one.

Interviewer (I): When you're ready, describe the initial moment when you noticed something was different.

Participant (L003): (Pauses) It started in my chest, a tightness, like a knot.

Interviewer (I): A knot in your chest. Can you describe more about this sensation? How did it feel, exactly?

Participant (L003): It was like... my chest was being squeezed. I could barely breathe. It felt very heavy.

Interviewer (I): It felt heavy and squeezed. And as this was happening, what changes did you notice in your breathing?

Participant (L003): My breathing got really fast and shallow. I was trying to take deep breaths, but I couldn't.

Interviewer (I): You couldn't take deep breaths. What was going through your mind as you tried to breathe deeply?

Participant (L003): Panic. I was thinking, "Why can't I breathe?" I was scared I was going to suffocate.

Interviewer (I): You were scared of suffocating. And in this moment of panic, what did you feel in your body besides the tightness in your chest and the difficulty breathing?

Participant (L003): My hands were trembling, and I felt this cold rush starting from my back going all the way to my arms.

Interviewer (I): A cold rush from your back to your arms. Can you describe more about this sensation?

Participant (L003): It was like... a wave of cold water running inside my skin. It made my body shiver.

Interviewer (I): A wave of cold water making your body shiver. How did the sensation of time feel during this experience?

Participant (L003): Time felt... slowed down. Everything was happening so fast, but it felt like I was stuck in that moment forever.

Interviewer (I): Time felt slowed down, yet everything was happening fast. As you were stuck in that moment, what happened next?

Participant (L003): I started to feel dizzy, like the room was spinning around me.

Interviewer (I): The room was spinning. And how did this dizziness affect your sense of self, your sense of being in that moment?

Participant (L003): I felt detached, like I was watching myself from outside my body. I couldn't recognize myself in that panic.

Interviewer (I): You felt detached, watching yourself from outside. What did you do to try to regain control or to cope with these sensations?

Participant (L003): I tried focusing on objects around me, naming them in my mind to ground myself.

Interviewer (I): Focusing on objects and naming them. Did this strategy change the sensations you were experiencing? How did your body respond?

Participant (L003): Slowly, the tightness in my chest began to loosen. My breathing became a bit easier, not normal, but better.

Interviewer (I): The tightness began to loosen, and breathing became easier. As this shift happened, what changes did you notice in your thoughts or emotions?

Participant (L003): I started to feel a bit more in control. The fear was still there, but it wasn't overwhelming anymore.

Interviewer (I): Feeling more in control, with less overwhelming fear. And how did this change in control and fear affect your perception of time?

Participant (L003): Time started to feel normal again. Like I was moving forward instead of being stuck.

Interviewer (I): Time felt normal, moving forward. Looking back at this experience now, how do you perceive this moment of anxiety or panic?

Participant (L003): It feels like a reminder of how powerful the mind and body connection is. It was terrifying, but it also showed me I could regain control, even if slowly.

Interviewer (I): A reminder of the mind and body connection, and regaining control. Thank you for sharing this deeply personal experience. How do you feel now, having revisited this moment?

Participant (L003): It was intense to relive it, but talking about it, breaking it down... it's therapeutic in a way. I feel a bit lighter.

Interviewer (I): I'm glad to hear that sharing has been therapeutic for you. Remember, this space is always here for you to explore and understand your experiences. Thank you for your trust and openness today.

Participant (L003): Thank you for guiding me through this. It really helped.
