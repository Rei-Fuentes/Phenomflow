<I> Let's begin by establishing a comfortable space for our conversation today. Are you okay with exploring a moment of deep sadness or grief from your past, knowing you can stop at any time?
<L014> Yes, I'm okay with that. I understand.
<I> Great, thank you. I want to remind you to focus on the sensations, emotions, and experiences as they come. Let's start by finding a specific moment of deep sadness or grief. Take your time to identify this moment.
<L014> (Pauses, breathes deeply) Okay, I have a moment in mind.
<I> When you're ready, could you describe the setting of this moment?
<L014> It was in my living room, late evening, the room was dimly lit, just a lamp on.
<I> In this dimly lit living room, what's the first thing that captures your attention as you relive this moment?
<L014> The weight in my chest, it was heavy.
<I> This weight in your chest, can you describe it more? How did it feel?
<L014> Like a dense, heavy ball, making it hard to breathe.
<I> Hard to breathe. And as you felt this weight, what else did you notice in your body or around you?
<L014> (Closes eyes) My hands were cold, and there was this... silence, enveloping everything.
<I> Cold hands and silence. Let's explore this silence a bit more. What was the quality of this silence?
<L014> It was thick, almost tangible, like it was filling up the space.
<I> Thick silence filling up the space. And in this moment, with the heavy chest and the silence, what happened next?
<L014> I started to cry, tears just came without any sound.
<I> Tears came without any sound. As you cried, how did the sensation in your chest change, if at all?
<L014> It... it started to spread, like the heaviness was moving into my throat.
<I> The heaviness spread into your throat. How did that affect your breathing or your ability to cry?
<L014> It made it harder to swallow, and my sobs were... stifled, trapped.
<I> Harder to swallow, sobs stifled and trapped. During this, what were you aware of in terms of your surroundings?
<L014> Not much, it's like the room faded away, and all I could focus on was the pain.
<I> The room faded away, focusing on the pain. Can you describe this pain more? Was it purely physical, or was there more to it?
<L014> It was both physical and emotional. Like every sob was trying to expel the sadness from my body.
<I> Trying to expel the sadness. And as you were in this state, did you notice any changes in your perception of time?
<L014> Yes, time seemed to slow down. Each second felt longer, drawn out.
<I> Time slowed down, each second drawn out. In this slowed time, did your sense of self or identity shift in any way?
<L014> I felt... smaller, diminished somehow, as if the grief was consuming me.
<I> Smaller, diminished. As if consumed by grief. Let's zoom into the moment you felt the smallest or most consumed. What do you notice?
<L014> (Pauses) There's this... emptiness, despite the heaviness. Like I was hollow.
<I> Emptiness, yet heavy and hollow. And in this emptiness, how did your body respond or change?
<L014> My body felt rigid, frozen, yet paradoxically, there was a trembling, an uncontrollable shaking.
<I> Rigid, frozen, with uncontrollable shaking. How did this physical state impact your emotional or mental state?
<L014> It intensified the sadness, made it feel more... real, more present.
<I> Intensified sadness, more real and present. And in this intensity, did anything eventually shift or change for you?
<L014> Eventually, the shaking subsided, and a numbness set in. It was as if my body and emotions just... gave up.
<I> The shaking subsided, numbness set in. As your body and emotions gave up, what was the next thing you became aware of?
<L014> A sense of exhaustion, but also... a strange peace. Like the worst had passed.
<I> Exhaustion and a strange peace, as if the worst had passed. Reflecting on this moment now, how do you perceive it? Has your understanding or feeling towards it changed?
<L014> Reflecting now, it feels like a necessary release. Painful, but... cleansing. My understanding hasn't changed, but my acceptance of it has.
<I> A necessary release, painful yet cleansing, with acceptance. Thank you for sharing this deeply personal experience. How are you feeling right now, after revisiting this moment?
<L014> It's been tough, but I feel lighter having shared it. Like acknowledging it openly has its own kind of healing.
<I> Feeling lighter and acknowledging the healing. I appreciate your openness and courage today. Is there anything else you'd like to add or explore about this experience?
<L014> No, I think we've covered it. Thank you for guiding me through this.
<I> Thank you for your trust and willingness to explore this with me. If you need a moment or anything else, I'm here.
