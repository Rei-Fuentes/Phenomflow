Interviewer (I): Before we begin, I want to ensure you're comfortable and understand what we'll be doing today. We'll explore a moment of intense joy you've experienced, focusing on your sensations, feelings, and perceptions during that time. Are you okay with that?

Participant (L004): Yes, I'm okay with that. I'm ready.

Interviewer (I): Great. Let's start by finding a specific moment of intense joy or elation. Take your time to remember such a moment. Once you have it, please describe the setting briefly.

Participant (L004): (Closes eyes, smiles) Okay, I've got one. It was when I was at the beach, watching the sunset with my best friend.

Interviewer (I): At the beach with your best friend, watching the sunset. Let's go back to that moment. Try to relive it as if it's happening right now. What's the first thing you're aware of?

Participant (L004): (Pauses) The warmth of the sun on my skin. It's like a gentle hug.

Interviewer (I): The warmth of the sun, like a gentle hug. And as you feel this warmth, what happens inside you?

Participant (L004): I feel a spreading sensation, like warmth isn't just on my skin but inside me, filling me up.

Interviewer (I): This spreading sensation, filling you up, tell me more about that. How does it unfold?

Participant (L004): It starts in my chest, then flows into my arms and legs. It's like the warmth is light, and it's lighting me up from the inside.

Interviewer (I): Lighting you up from the inside. And as this light fills you, what changes in your perception of the moment?

Participant (L004): Everything seems brighter, more vibrant. The colors of the sunset are more intense. It's like the world has come alive.

Interviewer (I): The world comes alive in vibrant colors. In this aliveness, how do you feel about time?

Participant (L004): (Pauses, reflects) Time... it feels like it slows down. I'm so absorbed in the moment, every second feels significant, full.

Interviewer (I): Time slows down, every second feels full. And in this slowed time, how do you experience yourself and your friend?

Participant (L004): I feel connected, like there's no separation between us. We're sharing this moment, and it's like our joy is bouncing back and forth, amplifying.

Interviewer (I): Connected, no separation, joy amplifying. Let's zoom into that feeling of connection. What's happening in your body at this moment?

Participant (L004): My heart feels open, expansive. It's like my heart space has grown, and there's this warm, tingling sensation around it.

Interviewer (I): Your heart feels open, expansive, with a warm, tingling sensation. And as your heart opens, what shifts in your sense of self?

Participant (L004): (Smiles) I feel like I'm more than just me. I'm part of something bigger, part of this beautiful moment, the sunset, the warmth, my friend's laughter.

Interviewer (I): Feeling part of something bigger. Let's explore that sense of being part of the sunset, the warmth, your friend's laughter. What's that like, being part of it all?

Participant (L004): It's freeing. Like all the worries I usually have just fall away. I'm just here, present, and everything is okay. More than okay, it's perfect.

Interviewer (I): Freeing, worries fall away, everything is perfect. As you're present in this perfection, how does this moment of joy conclude?

Participant (L004): The sun finally sets, and there's this peaceful silence. We sit there, soaking it in. And then, we hug. It's a long, tight hug. I feel grateful, so grateful.

Interviewer (I): Peaceful silence, a long, tight hug, feeling grateful. As we come back to now, how do you feel recalling this moment of intense joy?

Participant (L004): I feel warm, happy. It's like I can still feel a bit of that joy and connection now.

Interviewer (I): Warm, happy, still feeling a bit of that joy and connection. Thank you for sharing this beautiful moment with me. How are you feeling about this exploration we did?

Participant (L004): I'm amazed. I didn't realize how much was there in that moment, all the sensations and feelings. It's like I've just relived it. Thank you.

Interviewer (I): You're welcome. It's been a privilege to explore this moment with you. Remember, this joy and connection are always a part of you.
