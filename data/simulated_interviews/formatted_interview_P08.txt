<I> Let's begin by creating a comfortable space for you to recall a specific experience. Today, we'll focus on a moment when you forgot something important. Are you okay with exploring this experience together?
<L008> Yes, I'm okay with that.
<I> Great. I'd like you to take a moment to close your eyes (L008 closes eyes) and take a few deep breaths. When you feel ready, I want you to bring to mind a specific instance when you forgot something important. Can you recall such a moment?
<L008> (Pauses) Yes, I have a moment in mind.
<I> Good. Let's stay with this moment. Can you describe where you are and what's happening around you in this memory?
<L008> I'm standing in my kitchen, in front of the fridge. It's morning, and there's sunlight coming through the window.
<I> You're in your kitchen, in front of the fridge, with sunlight coming through the window. What are you doing in that moment?
<L008> I'm trying to remember why I opened the fridge. I know I needed something, but I can't recall what it was.
<I> You're trying to remember why you opened the fridge. What do you feel in your body as you try to remember?
<L008> (Pauses) There's a slight tension in my forehead, like a tightening.
<I> A tightening in your forehead. And as you notice this tightening, what happens next?
<L008> I start to feel a bit anxious, like there's a pressure in my chest.
<I> There's a pressure in your chest. Can you describe this pressure more?
<L008> It's like a heavy weight sitting right in the middle of my chest. It makes it a bit harder to breathe.
<I> A heavy weight making it harder to breathe. And what are you thinking as you feel this weight?
<L008> I'm thinking, "Why can't I remember this?" It feels frustrating.
<I> "Why can't I remember this?" And how does this frustration manifest in your body?
<L008> My shoulders tense up, and I feel a bit warmer, especially around my neck.
<I> Your shoulders tense up, and you feel warmer around your neck. While you're standing there, feeling this tension and warmth, what do you do next?
<L008> I close the fridge and lean against it, trying to calm down.
<I> You close the fridge and lean against it. What do you feel in your body as you lean against the fridge?
<L008> The coolness of the fridge door against my back feels a bit soothing. It's a slight relief.
<I> The coolness is soothing, a slight relief. And in this moment of slight relief, what shifts in your experience?
<L008> I start to let go of trying to remember. It's like my body relaxes a bit more, and the pressure in my chest lightens.
<I> Your body relaxes, and the pressure lightens. As your body relaxes, what happens to the sense of frustration?
<L008> It starts to fade away. I'm still annoyed, but it's not as intense.
<I> The frustration fades but remains slightly. And in this state of reduced frustration, what do you become aware of in your surroundings?
<L008> I notice the sound of birds outside the window. It's like I hadn't heard them until now.
<I> You notice the sound of birds. And how does noticing this sound affect your experience in that moment?
<L008> It's calming. The sound pulls me away from my frustration and helps me feel more present.
<I> The sound is calming and makes you feel more present. As you stand there, feeling more present, what do you decide to do next?
<L008> I decide to make coffee instead. It's like I accept that I can't remember and move on.
<I> You decide to make coffee and move on. How does making this decision feel in your body?
<L008> It feels like a release. My shoulders drop, and the tension in my forehead eases.
<I> There's a release, and the tension eases. And as you begin to make coffee, how does the atmosphere in the kitchen seem to you now?
<L008> It feels lighter, more relaxed. Even the sunlight seems brighter, more welcoming.
<I> The atmosphere is lighter and more relaxed. And in this lighter atmosphere, how do you feel about yourself?
<L008> I feel okay. A bit amused at myself for getting so worked up over something so small.
<I> You feel okay and a bit amused. Looking back at this experience now, what stands out to you about the process of forgetting and then moving past it?
<L008> What stands out is how physical the experience is. The tension, the pressure, and then the release. It's like my body knew how to let go before my mind did.
<I> The physical experience stands out, with your body knowing how to let go before your mind. Reflecting on this, how do you feel about the experience of forgetting now?
<L008> I feel more accepting of it. It's a reminder to not get too caught up in the moment and to trust my body's response.
<I> More accepting and trusting of your body's response. Thank you for sharing this experience with me. How do you feel now, having revisited this moment?
<L008> I feel lighter, like talking about it has helped me process it in a new way. Thank you for guiding me through this.
<I> I'm glad to hear that. Thank you for your openness and willingness to explore this experience together.
