Interviewer (I): Claire
Participant (P): L018
Topic: Waking up from a vivid dream
Method: Micro-phenomenological interview.

Interviewer (I): Let's begin by creating a comfortable space for you to recall a specific experience. Today, we'll focus on the moment you woke up from a vivid dream. Are you comfortable with this?
Participant (L018): Yes, I am comfortable with that.
Interviewer (I): Great. I want you to close your eyes (L018 closes eyes) and take a few deep breaths. When you're ready, try to recall the moment of waking up from that vivid dream. Can you picture that moment?
Participant (L018): (Pauses) Yes, I can see it now.
Interviewer (I): Good. Let's stay with that moment. Can you describe the first thing you became aware of as you were waking up?
Participant (L018): (Breathes deeply) The first thing... was a sense of falling, like dropping suddenly from a height.
Interviewer (I): You felt like you were falling. Can you describe that sensation a bit more? How did it manifest in your body?
Participant (L018): It was in my stomach mostly, like when you go down a steep hill too fast. My stomach felt light but also tight.
Interviewer (I): Light but also tight. And as you were experiencing this sensation in your stomach, what happened next?
Participant (L018): (Pauses) Then, there was this jolt, as if I hit the ground, but it was soft, not painful.
Interviewer (I): A soft jolt. What did you notice in your body at that moment of the soft jolt?
Participant (L018): My body... it sort of jerked awake, but my limbs felt heavy, like they were lagging behind my consciousness.
Interviewer (I): Your limbs felt heavy. Can you describe that heaviness? How did it differ from the lightness in your stomach?
Participant (L018): The heaviness was like being wrapped in a thick blanket, difficult to move. The lightness was more internal, a sensation inside my stomach. The heaviness was external, in my arms and legs.
Interviewer (I): Interesting contrast between internal lightness and external heaviness. As you became aware of these sensations, what did you become aware of next?
Participant (L018): (Closes eyes tighter) I started to hear sounds, the real world creeping in. The sound of my fan and a bird outside my window.
Interviewer (I): The real world creeping in. Can you describe how the transition from the dream sounds to the real-world sounds occurred?
Participant (L018): It was gradual. At first, the dream sounds were more like echoes, and then they faded. The fan's whirring and the bird's chirping became clearer, more pronounced.
Interviewer (I): As the real-world sounds became clearer, how did your sense of the room around you change?
Participant (L018): My sense of the room... it started to materialize around me. At first, it was just darkness with the sounds, but then I could sense the walls, the bed beneath me. I didn't open my eyes yet, but I knew where everything was.
Interviewer (I): You knew where everything was. How did this knowing manifest for you? Was it a visual knowing, or something else?
Participant (L018): It wasn't visual, not exactly. It was more like a spatial awareness. I could feel the space around me, the emptiness of the room, and where things should be.
Interviewer (I): Spatial awareness. And during this transition, how did your sense of time change?
Participant (L018): Time... it felt slow, like I was moving through syrup. Every sensation seemed elongated, drawn out.
Interviewer (I): Moving through syrup. That's a vivid description. As time felt slow, what happened to your sense of self, your identity, during this transition?
Participant (L018): My sense of self was blurry. I wasn't fully me yet, still partly in the dream, partly in the waking world. It was like being two people at once, but also neither.
Interviewer (I): Being two people at once, but also neither. Can you describe that experience a bit more? How did it feel to be in that in-between state?
Participant (L018): It was disorienting but also calming in a way. Like I was floating between two worlds, not fully anchored to either. There was a sense of freedom in it, but also a longing to be fully awake, fully myself again.
Interviewer (I): Floating between two worlds. As you longed to be fully awake, what was the next sensation or thought that brought you closer to full wakefulness?
Participant (L018): (Pauses, then smiles slightly) The sensation of my bed sheets. I moved my leg slightly, and the coolness of the sheets against my skin made me more aware of my physical body.
Interviewer (I): The coolness of the sheets. How did this tactile sensation affect your transition to wakefulness?
Participant (L018): It grounded me. Made the transition sharper, more immediate. My awareness of the room, the sounds, and my own body became more focused. I was more in the here and now.
Interviewer (I): More in the here and now. And as you became more grounded, how did your sense of time and self adjust?
Participant (L018): Time normalized. It didn't feel slow anymore. And my sense of self solidified. I was fully me again, no longer floating between worlds.
Interviewer (I): Fully you again. When you reached this point of full wakefulness, how did you feel emotionally?
Participant (L018): Relieved, mostly. There was a bit of sadness leaving the dream behind, but also a sense of refreshment, like I had been on a journey and was now back.
Interviewer (I): Relieved, with a sense of refreshment. Looking back at this experience now, how do you perceive it? What stands out to you?
Participant (L018): What stands out is how fluid the transition between dreaming and waking can be. It's fascinating how the mind and body navigate that space. It makes me appreciate the complexity of our consciousness.
Interviewer (I): The complexity of our consciousness. Thank you for sharing this experience with such detail. How do you feel now, having revisited this moment?
Participant (L018): I feel... contemplative, I guess. It's interesting to dissect an experience like this, to see all the layers. I'm grateful for the opportunity to explore it with you.
Interviewer (I): I'm grateful for your openness and willingness to explore. Thank you for participating in this journey with me.
