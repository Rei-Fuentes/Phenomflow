<I> Let's begin by establishing what we're here to explore together. We're going to revisit a specific experience you've had, the feeling of being watched. It's important that you feel comfortable and safe as we go through this process. Are you okay with that?

<L015> Yes, I'm okay with that. I'm ready.

<I> Great. I want to remind you that if at any point you feel uncomfortable, we can pause or stop. Let's start by finding a moment in your past where you distinctly felt like you were being watched. Do you have a specific instance in mind?

<L015> (Nods) Yes, there's this one time that really stands out to me.

<I> Good. I'd like you to take a moment to close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment. Take your time to really get into that experience. Notice the environment around you, what you're doing, and how you're feeling. Let me know when you're there.

<L015> (Closes eyes, breathes deeply) Okay, I'm there.

<I> You're there. Let's stay with this moment for a bit. Can you describe your surroundings?

<L015> I'm outside, it's evening, not too dark yet but the sun has set. I'm walking down a street, it's quite empty, just a few streetlights on.

<I> You're walking down an empty street in the evening. What are you feeling in your body as you walk?

<L015> There's this... tension, I guess. My shoulders are tight, and there's a heaviness in my stomach.

<I> Tension in your shoulders, heaviness in your stomach. And as you notice this tension and heaviness, what else becomes apparent to you?

<L015> (Pauses) My steps. They're quick, almost like I'm trying to walk faster without realizing it.

<I> Your steps are quick, almost as if you're walking faster without realizing. And in this moment, as you're walking with quick steps, what do you become aware of next?

<L015> That's when I feel it. The feeling of being watched. It's like a prickling on the back of my neck, a cold sensation.

<I> A prickling on the back of your neck, a cold sensation. Can you describe more about this sensation? Is it moving or static?

<L015> It's static but intense. Like someone's gaze is fixed on me, but when I look around, there's no one.

<I> It's static and intense, like a fixed gaze. And as you look around and see no one, what happens inside you?

<L015> I start to feel this rush, a mix of fear and alertness. My heart is beating faster, and it's like my senses are heightened.

<I> A rush of fear and alertness, your heart beating faster, senses heightened. In this heightened state, how do you perceive time?

<L015> (Pauses, seems to search for words) Time... it's like it slows down. Every second feels longer, more drawn out.

<I> Time slows down, every second feels longer. And in this slowed-down time, how is your sense of self? Are you more in your body, or does it feel different?

<L015> It's strange, I feel more in my body, like I'm hyper-aware of every sensation, but at the same time, there's this part of me that's... detached, observing everything.

<I> More in your body, hyper-aware, yet part of you is detached, observing. As you're in this state, what do you do next?

<L015> I... I decide to turn around and take a different path. As I turn, the sensation starts to fade, but the fear lingers a bit.

<I> You decide to turn and take a different path. The sensation starts to fade, but the fear lingers. As the sensation fades, what changes in your body?

<L015> My shoulders start to relax, and the heaviness in my stomach lessens. My steps slow down to a normal pace.

<I> Your shoulders relax, the heaviness lessens, steps slow down. And as you walk away, how does the environment around you appear now?

<L015> It looks the same, but it feels different. Like I've just walked out of a different world back into this one.

<I> It looks the same but feels different, as if you've walked back into this world from a different one. Reflecting on this experience now, how do you understand that feeling of being watched?

<L015> (Opens eyes, takes a moment) It's like my body knew something my mind didn't. Or maybe it did, but it's not something I can easily put into words. It's a primal feeling, a reminder that we're not always as alone as we think.

<I> Your body knew something your mind didn't, a primal feeling, a reminder we're not always as alone as we think. Thank you for sharing this experience with such detail. How are you feeling now, having revisited this moment?

<L015> It was intense, reliving it, but I feel okay. It's interesting to look at it so closely, to understand the layers of what I felt.

<I> It's been an intense journey, but I'm glad you feel okay and find it interesting to explore these layers. Thank you for your openness and for taking this journey with me. Is there anything else you'd like to add or ask before we conclude?

<L015> No, I think that's everything. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's given me a lot to think about.

<I> You're welcome. Thank you for your trust and willingness to explore deeply. Take care.
