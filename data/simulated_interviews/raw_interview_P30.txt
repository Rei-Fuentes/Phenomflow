Interviewer (I): Claire
Participant (P): L030
Topic: Anxiety or panic attack
Method: Micro-phenomenological interview.

Interviewer (I): Let's start by establishing what we're here to do today. We'll be exploring a specific experience you've had with anxiety or a panic attack. Remember, there's no right or wrong answers, just your experience. Are you comfortable with that?

Participant (L030): Yes, I'm okay with that.

Interviewer (I): Great. I want you to take a moment to recall a specific incident where you felt a strong sense of anxiety or had a panic attack. Don't tell me about it yet, just get a sense of that moment in your mind. Let me know when you have it.

Participant (L030): (Closes eyes, takes a deep breath) Okay, I have it.

Interviewer (I): Now, I'd like you to go back to that moment as if it's happening right now. Where are you?

Participant (L030): I'm in my car, parked outside a grocery store.

Interviewer (I): In your car. And as you're there, what's the first thing you notice as the experience begins?

Participant (L030): My hands... they start to sweat, and there's this tightness in my chest.

Interviewer (I): Your hands start to sweat, and there's a tightness in your chest. Can you describe that tightness a bit more? How does it feel?

Participant (L030): It's like a band around my chest, squeezing.

Interviewer (I): A band squeezing. And as you feel this band squeezing, what happens next?

Participant (L030): I start to breathe faster, shallow breaths.

Interviewer (I): You breathe faster, shallow breaths. And how do you feel about this change in your breathing?

Participant (L030): It scares me. I feel like I can't get enough air.

Interviewer (I): It scares you. You can't get enough air. What do you do in response to that feeling?

Participant (L030): I try to take deeper breaths, but it doesn't really help. It feels like I'm fighting to breathe.

Interviewer (I): You're fighting to breathe. And as this is happening, what do you notice about your surroundings?

Participant (L030): Everything starts to feel distant, like I'm there but not fully. Sounds seem muffled.

Interviewer (I): Sounds seem muffled, and everything feels distant. What's happening in your body at this point?

Participant (L030): My heart is racing, and there's this dizziness, like I might faint.

Interviewer (I): Your heart is racing, and there's dizziness. And in this moment, what are you thinking?

Participant (L030): That I'm going to die, that I can't control it.

Interviewer (I): You think you're going to die. And as you think that, how does your body respond?

Participant (L030): It just ramps up, more intense. The fear is overwhelming.

Interviewer (I): The fear is overwhelming. Can you tell me more about that fear? What does it feel like in your body?

Participant (L030): It's all-consuming. My stomach knots up, and there's this cold rush that goes through me.

Interviewer (I): A cold rush. And during this experience, how do you perceive time?

Participant (L030): Time... it's like it slows down. Every second feels longer.

Interviewer (I): Time slows down. And in this slowed-down time, what do you do next?

Participant (L030): I remember trying to focus on something, anything. I looked at the clock in my car.

Interviewer (I): You looked at the clock. And as you focus on the clock, what do you notice in your body?

Participant (L030): My breathing starts to slow a bit, the tightness in my chest loosens slightly.

Interviewer (I): The tightness loosens slightly. And how does that change make you feel?

Participant (L030): A little hopeful, like maybe I can get through this.

Interviewer (I): Hopeful. And then what happens?

Participant (L030): I keep focusing on my breathing, on the clock, and gradually, the panic starts to fade.

Interviewer (I): The panic starts to fade. And as it fades, what changes in your sensations?

Participant (L030): My heart rate slows, the dizziness subsides, and I start to feel more present, less detached.

Interviewer (I): More present. And how does your sense of self change as you become more present?

Participant (L030): I start to feel more in control, like I'm not just my fear. I'm me, and I'm okay.

Interviewer (I): You're you, and you're okay. And looking back at this experience now, how do you feel about it?

Participant (L030): It's still scary to think about, but I also feel a bit stronger knowing I got through it.

Interviewer (I): Feeling a bit stronger. Thank you for sharing this with me. How are you feeling right now, talking about this?

Participant (L030): It's been intense reliving it, but I'm okay. It feels good to talk about it, actually.

Interviewer (I): I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything else you'd like to add or explore about this experience?

Participant (L030): No, I think we covered it. Thank you for helping me go through it like this.

Interviewer (I): Of course. Thank you for your openness and courage in sharing this experience. Remember, this conversation is a step towards understanding and healing. Take care.
