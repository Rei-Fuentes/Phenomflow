Interviewer (I): Claire
Participant (P): L024
Topic: Moment of decision making
Method: Micro-phenomenological interview.

Interviewer (I): Let's start by making sure you're comfortable and that the purpose of our session today is clear to you. We're going to explore a moment of decision-making in your life in great detail. Are you okay with that?

Participant (L024): Yes, I'm comfortable and ready to start.

Interviewer (I): Great. I'd like you to recall a specific moment of decision-making. Don't tell me about it yet, just get a sense of that moment in your mind. Let me know when you have it.

Participant (L024): (Nods, closes eyes for a moment) Okay, I have it.

Interviewer (I): Now, I want you to go back to that moment as if it's happening right now. Try to relive it as vividly as possible. What's the first thing you become aware of?

Participant (L024): (Pauses) I'm standing in my kitchen.

Interviewer (I): You're standing in your kitchen. And as you're standing there, what sensations are you aware of in your body?

Participant (L024): My hands are cold... and there's this tightness in my stomach.

Interviewer (I): Your hands are cold, and there's a tightness in your stomach. Let's stay with that tightness for a moment. Can you describe it more?

Participant (L024): It's like a knot... very concentrated in the center of my stomach.

Interviewer (I): A knot in the center of your stomach. And how does this sensation affect you in that moment?

Participant (L024): It makes me feel anxious... like I'm on the edge of something.

Interviewer (I): You feel anxious, on the edge of something. And as you're feeling this, what happens next?

Participant (L024): I take a deep breath... (inhales deeply) and I start to feel a bit more grounded.

Interviewer (I): You take a deep breath and start to feel more grounded. When you take that deep breath, what changes in your body?

Participant (L024): The knot loosens a bit, and my hands... they start to warm up.

Interviewer (I): The knot loosens, and your hands warm up. Now, let's move forward in this moment of decision. What do you do next?

Participant (L024): I look at the paper on the counter... and I realize I have to make a choice.

Interviewer (I): You look at the paper and realize you have to make a choice. As you're looking at the paper, what are you seeing?

Participant (L024): It's a letter... an acceptance letter for a job.

Interviewer (I): An acceptance letter for a job. And how do you feel as you're looking at this letter?

Participant (L024): Excited but also really scared.

Interviewer (I): Excited but scared. Can you tell me more about that fear?

Participant (L024): It's like... what if I make the wrong choice? What if this isn't what I'm supposed to do?

Interviewer (I): What if you make the wrong choice. And as you're wrestling with this question, what sensations do you notice in your body?

Participant (L024): My heart starts racing, and the tightness in my stomach comes back, but stronger this time.

Interviewer (I): Your heart races, and the tightness returns, stronger. And in this moment, how does time feel to you?

Participant (L024): It feels like everything slows down... I'm just stuck in this moment of indecision.

Interviewer (I): Everything slows down, and you're stuck in this moment of indecision. As you're stuck there, what helps you move forward?

Participant (L024): (Pauses, then smiles slightly) I remember a conversation I had with my friend about taking chances.

Interviewer (I): You remember a conversation about taking chances. And how does remembering that conversation affect you?

Participant (L024): It's like a wave of warmth goes through me, and the tightness starts to dissipate.

Interviewer (I): A wave of warmth goes through you, and the tightness dissipates. And then what do you do?

Participant (L024): I pick up the pen and sign the letter.

Interviewer (I): You pick up the pen and sign the letter. As you're signing, what are you feeling in that exact moment?

Participant (L024): Relief... and a sense of excitement about the future.

Interviewer (I): Relief and excitement about the future. And how does your body respond to these feelings?

Participant (L024): My shoulders drop, like a weight has been lifted off them, and I can breathe more easily.

Interviewer (I): Your shoulders drop, and you can breathe more easily. Looking back at this moment now, how do you perceive this decision-making process?

Participant (L024): It was intense, but there was this underlying sense of knowing what I needed to do. It just took me a moment to listen to it.

Interviewer (I): An underlying sense of knowing what you needed to do. And how has this moment influenced your approach to decision-making since then?

Participant (L024): I've learned to trust my gut more, to listen to those bodily sensations because they're telling me something important.

Interviewer (I): Trusting your gut and listening to bodily sensations. Thank you for sharing this experience with me so vividly. How are you feeling now after revisiting this moment?

Participant (L024): I feel... lighter, somehow. Like talking about it has reaffirmed that I made the right choice.

Interviewer (I): Feeling lighter and reaffirmed in your choice. That's a powerful place to be. Thank you again for your openness and for going through this process with me. Is there anything else you'd like to add or reflect on before we conclude?

Participant (L024): No, I think we've covered everything. This was really helpful, thank you.

Interviewer (I): You're welcome, and thank you. It's been a privilege to explore this moment with you. Take care.
