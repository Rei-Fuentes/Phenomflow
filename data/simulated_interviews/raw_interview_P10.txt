Interviewer (I): Claire
Participant (P): L010
Topic: Moment of decision making
Method: Micro-phenomenological interview.

Interviewer (I): Let's begin by establishing what we're here to explore together. We're going to revisit a specific moment of decision-making in your life. It's important that you choose a moment that feels significant to you, one that you can recall vividly. Are you comfortable with this approach?

Participant (L010): Yes, I think I can do that. I have a moment in mind.

Interviewer (I): Great. Remember, our goal here is to explore your experience in as much detail as possible. We're interested in what you were sensing, feeling, and thinking at the time. Let's start by having you recall that moment. Take your time to get there in your mind. Can you describe where you are and what's happening around you?

Participant (L010): (Closes eyes) I'm standing in my kitchen, early morning, the light is dim... I'm deciding whether to accept a job offer that would require me to move across the country.

Interviewer (I): You're in your kitchen, it's early morning, and the light is dim. You're facing a significant decision. Let's stay with this scene for a moment. As you're standing there, what do you notice first in your body?

Participant (L010): There's a tightness in my stomach, like a knot.

Interviewer (I): A tightness, a knot in your stomach. Can you describe that sensation a bit more? Is it moving, static, does it have a temperature?

Participant (L010): It's static, cold... and heavy.

Interviewer (I): Static, cold, and heavy. Now, as you're noticing this sensation in your stomach, what's happening in your chest?

Participant (L010): My chest feels tight too, but it's different... it's like I can't breathe fully.

Interviewer (I): You can't breathe fully. Let's explore that sensation. Is it more on the surface or deep inside your chest?

Participant (L010): It's deep inside, like right in the center of my chest.

Interviewer (I): Right in the center of your chest. And as you're experiencing this tightness, what's happening in your throat?

Participant (L010): (Swallows) My throat feels dry, and it's hard to swallow.

Interviewer (I): Your throat feels dry, and it's hard to swallow. Now, let's shift our focus a bit. What are you seeing around you in the kitchen?

Participant (L010): The light is coming through the window, it's soft... I see the shadows of the objects on the counter. Everything seems still.

Interviewer (I): Everything seems still, with soft light and shadows. As you're standing there, noticing the light and the shadows, what do you hear?

Participant (L010): It's very quiet, but I can hear the sound of the clock ticking.

Interviewer (I): The sound of the clock ticking. And as you hear that ticking, what happens to your sense of time?

Participant (L010): Time feels... slowed down, like every tick is louder and more pronounced.

Interviewer (I): Time feels slowed down. Now, focusing on this moment when time feels slowed down, what's happening in your sense of self, your identity?

Participant (L010): I feel... torn. Part of me is excited about the new job, but another part is scared of leaving everything familiar behind.

Interviewer (I): Torn between excitement and fear. Let's delve deeper into that. When you say "torn", how does that manifest in your body?

Participant (L010): It's like there's a battle inside me. The excitement feels like a lightness in my shoulders, but the fear... it makes my legs feel heavy, rooted to the spot.

Interviewer (I): A battle inside, with lightness in your shoulders and heaviness in your legs. As you're experiencing this internal battle, what shifts or changes do you notice in your bodily sensations?

Participant (L010): (Pauses) The heaviness in my legs starts to spread up, but then... there's a moment when the lightness from my shoulders seems to push down, trying to balance it.

Interviewer (I): The lightness tries to balance the heaviness. And in this moment of trying to find balance, what changes in your thoughts?

Participant (L010): My thoughts start to clear a bit. I begin to think about the reasons I wanted the job in the first place, the opportunities it offers.

Interviewer (I): Your thoughts start to clear as you focus on the opportunities. And how does focusing on the opportunities affect your bodily sensations?

Participant (L010): The tightness in my chest starts to ease, and the knot in my stomach loosens a little.

Interviewer (I): The tightness eases, and the knot loosens. As this happens, what shifts in your emotions?

Participant (L010): I start to feel a sense of resolve, like I'm making peace with the decision.

Interviewer (I): A sense of resolve. And as you come to this sense of resolve, what happens to the sense of time?

Participant (L010): Time starts to feel normal again. The ticking of the clock isn't as loud or slow.

Interviewer (I): Time feels normal again. Now, looking back at this moment of decision-making, how do you perceive it from your current perspective?

Participant (L010): It feels like a pivotal moment, a turning point. I see it as a moment where I listened to myself, to all parts of myself.

Interviewer (I): A pivotal moment where you listened to all parts of yourself. Reflecting on this experience, how has it influenced your approach to decision-making since then?

Participant (L010): I've learned to pay more attention to my bodily sensations and emotions, not just my thoughts. They all have something important to say in moments of decision.

Interviewer (I): Paying more attention to bodily sensations and emotions. Thank you for sharing your experience with such detail. Is there anything else about this moment or what you've learned from it that you'd like to add?

Participant (L010): Just that it's surprising how much you can learn about yourself in a single moment, when you really pay attention.

Interviewer (I): It's surprising how much you can learn in a single moment. Thank you, that's a beautiful insight. I appreciate your openness and willingness to explore this moment with me.
