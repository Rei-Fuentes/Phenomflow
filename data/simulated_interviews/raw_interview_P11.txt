Interviewer (I): Let's start by finding a comfortable position. Are you ready to begin our journey into your experience?
Participant (L011): Yes, I'm ready.
Interviewer (I): Good. I'd like you to recall a moment when tasting a specific food brought back a vivid memory. Can you think of such a moment?
Participant (L011): (Nods) Yes, I can.
Interviewer (I): Great. Let's go there together. Take your time to bring this moment back to life in your mind. What is the first thing that comes to your awareness?
Participant (L011): (Closes eyes) The warmth of the kitchen.

**Evocation Phase**

Interviewer (I): The warmth of the kitchen. Can you describe more about this warmth? How does it feel?
Participant (L011): It's cozy, enveloping. Like a soft blanket around me.
Interviewer (I): A soft blanket around you. And as you feel this warmth, what happens next?
Participant (L011): I smell something... baking.
Interviewer (I): You smell something baking. Can you describe this smell?
Participant (L011): It's sweet, comforting. Like cinnamon and apples.

**Diachronic Exploration**

Interviewer (I): Cinnamon and apples. Let's explore this moment step by step. As you're standing there, enveloped in warmth, smelling cinnamon and apples, what do you do next?
Participant (L011): I walk towards the oven. I'm anticipating.
Interviewer (I): Anticipating. What is this anticipation like?
Participant (L011): It's a mix of excitement and a bit of hunger. My mouth waters.
Interviewer (I): Your mouth waters. And then?
Participant (L011): I see the pie. My grandmother is taking it out of the oven.
Interviewer (I): You see the pie and your grandmother. How do you feel seeing her?
Participant (L011): Happy. Safe. Loved.

**Synchronic Exploration**

Interviewer (I): Happy, safe, loved. Let's zoom into the moment you see the pie. What do you see exactly?
Participant (L011): The crust is golden brown, steam rising. There are bits of apple peeking out.
Interviewer (I): Golden brown crust, steam rising. What happens inside you as you see this?
Participant (L011): I feel a warmth in my chest, different from the room's warmth. More... intimate.
Interviewer (I): More intimate. And then?
Participant (L011): She cuts a piece and hands it to me. The texture is soft, flaky.
Interviewer (I): Soft, flaky. As you take your first bite, what happens?
Participant (L011): (Pauses) Time slows. The flavors explode—cinnamon, apple, butter. It's overwhelming but in a gentle way.

**Micro-returns and Exploration of Sensory Modalities**

Interviewer (I): Time slows. Can you say more about how time slowing feels in your body?
Participant (L011): It's like everything outside this moment fades. My senses sharpen. I'm here, fully.
Interviewer (I): You're here, fully. And in this fullness, what do you taste exactly?
Participant (L011): The sweetness of the apples, the richness of the butter, and a hint of cinnamon spice. It's complex.
Interviewer (I): Complex. How does this complexity feel in your mouth?
Participant (L011): It fills every part, like waves of flavor washing over me.
Interviewer (I): Waves of flavor. And what do you hear in this moment?
Participant (L011): The soft sound of the crust breaking, my grandmother's humming. It's peaceful.
Interviewer (I): Peaceful. As you're experiencing this peace, what shifts in your sense of self?
Participant (L011): I feel like a child again. Carefree. It's a part of me I thought I lost.
Interviewer (I): A part of you thought lost. And in this rediscovery, how does your body feel?
Participant (L011): Lighter. As if a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.
Interviewer (I): Lighter. And as we sit here now, reflecting on this experience, what stays with you the most?
Participant (L011): The connection. To my grandmother, to my past. It's like the pie bridged time and space.

**Closing**

Interviewer (I): The pie bridged time and space. That's a beautiful way to put it. How do you feel now, having revisited this moment?
Participant (L011): Grateful. And a bit emotional. It's more than just the taste; it's the love, the memories.
Interviewer (I): Grateful, emotional. Thank you for sharing this deeply personal experience with me. How are you feeling about our conversation?
Participant (L011): Thank you for guiding me through it. I feel... lighter, and it's comforting to reconnect with that moment.
Interviewer (I): I'm glad to hear that. Remember, this experience, this connection, is always a part of you. Thank you for your trust and openness today.
